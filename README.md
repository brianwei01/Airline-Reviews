The [first dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/juhibhojani/airline-reviews) used in this analysis was found on Kaggle, where a user scraped data from airlinequality.com. It consists of thousands of reviews for airlines worldwide, providing a detailed perspective on passenger experiences. Each entry in the dataset includes key attributes essential for airline analysis, such as airline name, overall rating, cabin staff service, in-flight entertainment, food and beverages, ground service, seat comfort, and value for money.

The [second dataset](https://simplemaps.com/data/world-cities) was obtained from simplemaps.com and contains a comprehensive list of world cities. This data includes prominent cities sourced from the NGIA, US Geological Survey, US Census Bureau, and NASA. This dataset was used to map departure cities to their respective countries for further analysis.
